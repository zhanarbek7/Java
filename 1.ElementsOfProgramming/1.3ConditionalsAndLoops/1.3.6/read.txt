1) IEEE 754 - standard for fractional numbers is used

Float - single precision
1 bit → Sign Bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative)
8 bits → Exponent (stores exponent with a bias of 127)
23 bits → Mantissa (Fraction) (stores the fractional part of the number, without the leading 1)

Double - double precision
1 bit → Sign Bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative)
11 bits → Exponent (stores exponent with a bias of 1023)
52 bits → Mantissa (Fraction) (stores the fractional part, without the leading 1)
